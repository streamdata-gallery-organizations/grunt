description: 'In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing
  repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the
  easier your job becomes. After youve configured it, a task runner can do most of
  that mundane work for you&mdash;and your team&mdash;with basically zero effort.'
